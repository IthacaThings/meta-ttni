The Things Network Ithaca mLinux layer

This layer depends on: meta-mlinux

This layer modifies mLinux for specific requirements of *The Things
Network* and maintaining a large number of Conduits.  It does this by:

A. Reducing the size of the image

Reducing the amount of bandwidth and storage that is needed for an
update.

This is done by removing packages and frameworks:

1. Java
2. Ruby
3. Perl
4. sqlite3
5. Lighthttpd
6. PHP
7. Default lora packages and mosquitto 

B. Adding useful tools

1. Useful utilities (sudo, htop, ntp, ntp-utils)
2. python packages required by Ansible (python-distutils, python-pkgutil)
3. Dependencies ttn-packet-forwarder (libmpsse)

A future goal is to remove node.js, but this is required to generate
the configuration files for 

C. How this works

The *preserve* package adds two init scripts:

1. preserve_config

This runs at shutdown and if /var/volatile/do_flash_upgrade exists,
makes a list of links into /var/config and stores them as an
executable shell script.

2. restore_config

This runs at startup only at the first boot after a firmware upgrade
and runs all scripts in /var/config/restore.d and /var/oem/restore.d
with run-parts.
