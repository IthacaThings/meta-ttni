The Things Network Ithaca layer

This layer depends on: meta-mlinux

This layer modifies mLinux for specific requirements of The Things
network and maintaining a large number of Conduits.  It does this by:

A. Reducing the size of the image

Reducing the amount of bandwidth and storage that is needed for an
update.

This is done by removing packages and frameworks:

1. Java
2. Ruby
3. Perl
4. sqlite3
5. Lighthttpd
6. PHP

B. Adding useful tools

1. sudo
2. python packages required by Ansible
3. ttn-packet-forwarder

C. Modifying init scripts

The unmountfs and config services are modified to allow perserving
more state when mLinux is being updated.  This allows updates to be
performed remotely.
